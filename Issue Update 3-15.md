# POST Issue Update for Week of 4/15

#### 1.[Issue #7, 4/8] Help Chelsea with table component
    a.4/19 - EXTENDED
    b.gap75
      i.[gap75, 4/16] - Tried to use the same Plotly request for data as in the Graph Component, but ran into dependency issues. Worked on getting them resolved.
      ii.[gap75, 4/17] - Dependency issues resolved, but ran into new bug. The current issue is that the HTML is designed to grab data from the TS file stored as an array in a field of the TableComponent class. Unfortunately, since the JSON data from the Plotly request is operated on within an asynchronous function, I cannot access the data field for the class.
      iii.[gap, 4/18] - Still debugging previous issue. Will probably try to make a more generic GET request for data instead of using the Plotly function.
