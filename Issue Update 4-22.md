# POST Issue Update for Week of 4/22

#### [Issue #7, 4/8] Work on table component
    a. 4/19 - CLOSED
    b. gap75
      i. [gap75, 4/23] Got the table to work using a simple GET request - currently only showing the last two weeks of data (same as graph)

#### [Issue #10, 4/24] Add pagination to table component
    a. 5/3 - OPEN
    b. gap75
      i. [gap75, 4/24] Would like to add pagination to the table - multiple pages instead of one giant table. The idea is that since users cannot access the database directly, we would like to present the data in a clearer way without needing them to rely on the graph. Ideally, we would be able to present ALL plant data in the table. Presenting this in one large table takes too long to load, but if we dynamically load it as each page is requested, we have a more feasible way to present the data. Started looking into how to do this
      ii. [gap75, 4/25] Continued looking into Angular libraries to simplify pagination.
