# POST Issue Update for Week of 3/11

#### 1. [Issue #1, 3/4] Extract all past data from ODK Aggregate
    a. 3/16 - EXTENDED
    b. gap75
       i. [gap75, 3/12] - Realized that the website is still plotting the latest data, so it does exist somewhere (obviously). Although we cannot directly access that data through a webpage, we can still make a GET request to pull the data as a JSON and work on it like that. Worked on figuring out how to make this request.
       ii. [gap75, 3/13] - Successfully got a JSON of all the latest data. However, the JSON is formatted differently from the JSON being published to Firebase from ODK Aggregate. Therefore, I worked on how to format the JSON properly
       iii. [gap75, 3/14] - Could not dedicate as much time to this issue due to upcoming symposium
