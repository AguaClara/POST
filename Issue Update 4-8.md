#### 5. [Issue #7, 4/8] Help Chelsea with table component
     a.4/19 - OPEN
     b.gap75
        i.[gap75, 4/9] Separate from the issue, but heard back from Minty in Honduras with regards to the email list. She said that plant operators don’t all have email addresses, and if they do they don’t generally make a habit of checking them regularly. She suggested to focus the emails on the water board as they can then, in person, encourage the operators to send data.  Spent this meeting thinking on how to restructure the emails for just the water board members.
        ii.[gap75, 4/10] Tried to create a sample table using Material. Ran into a lot of bugs from conflicting versions of Angular CLI, Material, and other Angular packages
        iii.[gap75, 4/11] Decided to just make a more standard table without using Material. Have a basic table with sample data. Now just need to incorporate the real data into the table.
